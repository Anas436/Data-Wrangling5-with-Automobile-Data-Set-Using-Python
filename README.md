# Data-Wrangling5-with-Automobile-Data-Set-Using-Python



In this notebooks shown basics operations of Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib which is so necessary for any Data Wrangling. If you does not understand data and does not perform Data Wrangling you could not find out proper result which will reflects your target forcasting. ___After completed Data Wrangling process like Missing value handling, Data standardization, Data normalization, Binning, Indicator variable and so on. Later we have a cleansed dataset with no missing values as well as all data has standard format which types of dataset is very essential for Data Scientist and Data Analyst to continuing their works.___

### Data Set Information
__________________________________________________________

This data set consists of three types of entities:

(a) The specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics.

(b) It's assigned insurance risk rating.

(c) Its normalized losses in use as compared to other cars. The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price. Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale. Actuarians call this process "symboling". A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.

The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year. This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons, sports/speciality, etc...), and represents the average loss per car per year.

Note: Several of the attributes in the database could be used as a "class" attribute.
